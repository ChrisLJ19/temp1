          <p>This story is very well written.
          Shelley clearly had a gift for expressing her ideas on the page.
          From a modern perspective, the story isn't that scary, but I imagine it
          might have freaked out some early-nineteenth-century readers.
          Beyond the 'horror' of its central conceit, the story is essentially
          one of obsession and how it can lead to loss, loneliness and despair.
          Victor Frankenstein at the end of the story is a pitiful figure. Everyone he
          once loved has been killed at the hands of the monster he created, and Victor
          sees no reason to go on. I guess much of this was driven by Mary Shelley's
          own personal fears - would she live to see her loved ones die, one by one, and end up alone?
          As it turned out, such a fate was not far from the truth, and this, I think,
          adds extra resonance to the story.
          My only gripe is that during the monster's narration he comes across as <em>much</em> too eloquent,
          given that he has had to learn language and conversation from scratch by listening to a family from a neighbouring
          house - perhaps this is a result of Shelley being incapable of writing bad or vernacular prose?
