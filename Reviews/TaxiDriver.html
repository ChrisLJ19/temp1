    <h1>My thoughts on the movie Taxi Driver (1976)</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Wow. This movie is generally regarded very highly, and quite rightly so.
      Atmospheric, brilliantly acted, unsettling, and open to as many interpretations
      as you wish to throw at it. The ending blew my mind, and a quick internet search revealed there has been
      much discussion of those final ten minutes over the forty-plus years since
      this movie came out. To me (but clearly not to the majority of viewers) it was obvious that
      the events after the almighty shoot-out were played purely from Travis Bickle's imagination - otherwise,
      how would he have got off so lightly with three cold-blooded murders?
      I think that those final scenes showed his motivations and hopes <em>before</em> the bloodbath, rather than (as some
      have suggested) his dying thoughts.
      But the more I thought about
      that ending, the more interesting the whole movie became. Given
      the fact that Travis is a pretty creepy guy, isn't it a bit odd that women and girls so thoughtlessly
      agreed to go out for a coffee with him? Could it be that <em>everything</em> in the movie was played
      from his imagination? Or maybe not? This, ultimately, is the power of the movie; so craftily written
      and directed that many interpretations are possible. The only irksome thing about the
      movie is the frequent product-placement shots for  a certain soft beverage. Otherwise, a masterpiece.
